Steps:

Do first set of slides --> explain what git is, upto the "Lets make a git repo" slide (17?)

Everyone should start --> make their own repo so that we can come up with their own username.github.com/codefest websites
--> Create a new repository on github
 		- call it 'codefest'
 		- explain what the different options are
--> clone the repository to local desktop
--> git status
--> create a new file called 'index.html' and add 'hello world' as the content
--> git status
--> git diff --color
--> git add index.html
-->	git commit -m "create hello world file"
--> git push
--> go onto github.com/username/codefest and see the changes
--> create a branch, so that it'll show up on username.github.io/codefest
--> git checkout -b gh-pages
--> git push
--> go to username.github.io/codefest


Now go back to the slides, and teach HTML/CSS

--> now start making the changes to the file
--> general page setup --> head/body split, css page
--> unicord background with header text
--> create main content section with the About Me text underneath
--> create a list of your favorite movies
--> add styling to the paragraph and list
--> add unicorn image gallery section
--> add a youtube video
--> gh-pages branch
--> add people in the class
	--> get everyone to clone my repository
	--> go into the index.html file
	--> add their name, and the link to their repository or gh-pages
	--> git add index.html
	--> git commit -m "added username's website"
	--> git push
